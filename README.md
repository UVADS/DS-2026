## Big ideas & Learning Outcomes

The following are the four ideas that I hope will persist with students after the minutia of the Poisson distribution has faded from memory.  Expand each section to see the associated learning outcomes and topics.

<details>
<summary>Probability is a framework for organizing beliefs; it is not a statement of what your beliefs should be.</summary>

| Learning outcomes | Topics |
|:------|:---|
| compare and contrast different definitions of probability, illustrating differences with simple examples | <ul><li>long-run proportion<li>personal beliefs<li>combination of beliefs and data |
| express the rules of probability verbally, mathematically, and computationally| <ul><li>AND, OR, complement, total probability<li>simulation error (relative and absolute) |
| illustrate the rules of probability with examples| |
| using long-run proportion definition of probability, derive the univariate rules of probability| |
| organize/express bivariate random variables in cross tables| |
| define joint, conditional, and marginal probabilities| |
| identify joint, conditional, and marginal probabilities in cross tables| |
| identify when a research question calls for a joint, conditional, or marginal probability| |
| describe the connection between conditional probabilities and prediction| |
| derive Bayes rule from cross tables| |

| determine if joint outcomes are independent| |
| calculate a measure of association between joint outcomes| |

</details>

<details>

</details>

## Classroom environment

The instructor may occasionally designate portions of class time as "No Laptop No Phone" periods. During these times, please put away laptops and cell phones in your bags. You're encouraged to take notes using paper and pencil instead. If you need to use your devices, you're welcome to step out of the classroom briefly. The instructor will provide gentle reminders about this policy, and continued non-compliance may result in point deductions from your final exam grade.

## Grading

Courses carrying a Data Science subject area use the following grading system: A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F.  The symbol W is used when a student officially drops a course before its completion or if the student withdraws from an academic program of the University.

Grading Scale: 

 - 93-100 A
 - 90-92 A- 
 - 87-89 B+
 - 83-86 B 
 - 80-82 B- 
 - 77-79 C+ 
 - 73-76 C 
 - 70-72 C- 
 - <70 F

Grades will be a weighted average of the final exam score (30%), the midterm exams (each 15%), the deliverables (20%) and homeworks (20%).

Homeworks are assigned regularly, and will appear in the course calendar.  Submission instructions are detailed in each assignment.  Two homework grades will be dropped when calculating the final grade.

Deliverables are larger assignments than homework.  To complete the deliverables, you will use probability models to build simulations of complex real world processes to answer questions.  Deliverables are graded with a score of 0, 1, or 2. After the initial grading, students may resubmit the deliverable within one week of feedback for an additional point. That is, an initial score of 1 can be bumped up to a 2. Likewise, a 0 can be bumped up to a 1.

Midterm exams are graded on a 100 point scale.  For midterm 1, if your grade on midterm 2 or the final is higher, the higher score will replace the score for midterm 1.  Likewise, for midterm 2, if your grade on the final exam is higher, the higher score will replace the score for midterm 2.  For example, suppose your exams scores for the midterms and final were 72, 88, 85.  For the purposes of the final grade, your exam scores would be 88, 88, 85.

## Final exam schedule

The final exam for both sections is **Saturday, December 13, 2025** from **9:00AM-12:00PM** in rooms DS 205, 206, 246.

## 2025 Calendar

## Adjustments

The instructor may alter the course content and grading policies during the semester.

## Collaborative learning

Students are encouraged to study together.  The instructions for each assignment/deliverable will indicate if and how students may work together.  Students should not collaborate on midterm or final exams.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on an assignment, deliverable, or exam will receive a score of 0 on the assignment, deliverable, or exam.  Students may be referred to UVA Honor Committee.

**University of Virginia Honor System.** All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia.  The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  âI pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)â.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.

## Accommodations

UVA is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC), to request an official accommodation. You can find more information about SDAC, including how to apply online, through their website at www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.
