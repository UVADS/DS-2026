# Roulette

The roulette deliverable with videos and code is available in the [course notes (link)](https://tgstewart.cloud/compprob/roulette.html).

## Assignment

In this assignment, you will write a blog post to explain how you used
computer simulation to understand the profitability of the
martingale betting strategy in roulette.

-   The audience of your blog post is a sharp college freshman with
    little to no background in data science.

-   You should explain how you used computer simulation to calculate the
    average earnings of a gambler that uses this strategy. As part of
    the explanation, provide a figure (or a series of figures) that show
    how the gamblers earnings (or losses) evolve over a series of wagers
    at the roulette wheel. (The x-axis will be the wager number (or play
    number), the y-axis will be available budget.) 

-   Show your audience how changing a parameter of the simulation (see
    table below) does or does not have an impact on average profit. Create a
    figure to show the impact.
    
-   Be sure to end with a take home message that answers the main question: **Is the strategy actually profitable?**.

-   Blog posts tend to be less formal than academic reports.  Feel free to include figures, gifs, memes, or videos that help the reader engage with the topic and your explanation.
