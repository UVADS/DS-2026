# Create a simple report using a notebook

In class, you wrote code which would generate a solution to the birthday problem.  In this assignment, you will create a document to explain the birthday problem and your computational solution for solving it.  The document should include:

1. An explanation of the birthday problem
2. An explanation of why it can be solved with simulation
3. A step-by-step explanation of your code
4. The results of the simulation


## Submission instructions

1. Render your report as a PDF.
2. Submit the report to Gradescope (specific instructions forthcoming).
