## Bayes and Kpop HW

### Question 1
Two students, A and B, each write long essays.

- Student A makes, on average, **2 errors per page**.  
- Student B makes, on average, **4 errors per page**.  

If a page from an essay is found without a name and it contains 3 errors, what is the probability that it was written by Student A, given that it has 3 errors?
(Hint 1: You may want to create a table to fill out) (Hint 2: Errors per page ~ Poisson)
