    "A self-contained workspace means you can change and tweak the set-up (including package versions) without impacting other projects.  For example, suppose project A relies on an older version of a package but project B needs the newer version of the package.  By using virtual environments, both versions of the package can be installed, avoiding a conflict that would arise if there was only one shared package library.\n",

We can check that the `pip` command was executed with the global version of python, not the executable of python specificly created for the virtual environment in which we are operating."
