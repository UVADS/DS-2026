Chunk labels are for debugging and organizing.  They do not appear in the rendered document.  For example, consider the `.qmd` file below.

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Understanding chunk labels"
format: markdown
---

```{python}
#| label: Setup
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
#| label: data management
A = np.random.choice(range(1,365),10)
B = max(A)
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: create table
C = pd.DataFrame({'id':range(9), 'roster':A})
print(C)
```
````

If we where to render the document, it would generate an error:

![](B.png)

Note that as Quarto renders the document, it indicates its progress by writing to the log.  If computation gets hung up, you'll be able to see which chunk is causing the issue.  If there is an error, the log will indicate in which chunk the error occured.  In this case, it flagged the `create table` chunk.

````{verbatim}
```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: create table2
C = pd.DataFrame({'id':range(9), 'roster':A})
print(C)
```
````

After investigation, we see that we made an "off-by-one" error.  After fixing it, the document will render.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
A = np.random.choice(range(1,365),10)
B = max(A)
```

```{python}
C = pd.DataFrame({'id':range(10), 'roster':A})
print(C)
```
