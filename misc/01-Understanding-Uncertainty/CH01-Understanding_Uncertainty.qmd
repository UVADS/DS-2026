### Uncertainty: A Pervasive Reality

*   **Definition:** Most statements are uncertain for you; you don't know if they're true or false.
*   **Personal Nature:**
    *   Uncertainty is personal; what's known or uncertain varies by individual.
    *   Degrees of uncertainty also differ between people.
    *   It's a unique relationship between a person ("you") and the world, not an objective property.

---

### Uncertainty: Ubiquity & History

*   **Ubiquity:**
    *   Uncertain statements far outnumber known truths/falsities for any individual.
    *   All statements about the future are uncertain.
    *   Uncertainty is omnipresent in our lives.
*   **Historical Context:**
    *   Systematic study began only in the 20th century.
    *   Earlier studies were limited to special types, like gambling.

### Examples of Uncertainty: Everyday

#### Weather Forecasts

*   "It will rain tomorrow" is uncertain for changeable climates.
*   Uncertainty is temporary, revealed by tomorrow.
*   Consulting sources (barometer, TV) can change its degree.

#### Historical Events

*   "The Princes in the Tower were murdered on the orders of Richard III" is an uncertain historical statement.
*   The full truth of past incidents is often unknown.
*   Historians may quantify doubts with probabilities (e.g., 98%).

### Examples of Uncertainty: Science & Finance

#### Medical Claims

*   "Selenium will reduce cancer chances" exemplifies medical uncertainty.
*   Many claims are uncertain, even for scientists.
*   Active science is full of uncertainty; experiments reduce it.

#### Financial Markets

*   "Shares in pharmaceutical companies will rise" is uncertain.
*   Doubt must be inferred; no clear odds like gambling.
*   Buyers/sellers often disagree on chances.

### Examples of Uncertainty: Predictions & Polls

#### Predictions & Forecasts

*   "Inflation next year will be 3.7%" appears firm but is uncertain.
*   Better to use ranges, e.g., "between 3.1% and 4.3%."

#### Polls & Surveys

*   "If an election were to be held tomorrow, 48% would vote Democrat" is uncertain.
*   Due to small sample sizes and changing/untruthful respondents.

### Examples of Uncertainty: High-Impact Events

#### Nuclear Accident

*   "A serious nuclear accident in Britain next year" involves extreme seriousness but very small chance.
*   Balancing these aspects is challenging.

### Probability: Measure of Beliefs

*   Probability provides a systematic approach to managing uncertainty.
*   **It measures the strength of your belief in an event's truth.**
*   Acts as logic applied to randomness, a framework for the unknown.
*   **Probability is personal, not an objective property** like distance.
    *   Depends on "you" and the event being observed.
    *   Uncertainty is a relationship between you and an event.

---

### Probability: Importance & Applications

*   **Rational Methodology:** Provides a framework for managing beliefs.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **Computations & Predictions:** Models randomness, predicts evolution.
    *   **Update Beliefs:** Incorporate new data/information.
    *   **Organize Beliefs Sensibly:** Establishes how beliefs should relate (like geometry rules).
    *   **Guide Actions:** Improves life by informing decisions (decision analysis).

### Probability: Conclusion

*   **Practical Use:** Combines multiple uncertainties with objectives for decisions (e.g., nuclear power plants: low probability, high impact).
*   **Overall:** Probability equips us with tools to calculate with uncertainties, transforming a complex phenomenon into a manageable calculus.
*   **Benefit:** Enables living comfortably with the unknown, rather than suppressing it.
